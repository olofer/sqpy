# sqpy
Plain-python sequential quadratic programming. Requires `numpy`, `scipy.sparse`, `scipy.linalg`, and `scipy.sparse.linalg`. Some examples and test programs require `cvxopt` as reference solver. Some examples require `sympy` for automatic generation of Jacobian and Hessian functions. Includes a non-trivial demo application (`sym-lv.ipynb`) using trapezoidal transcription of nonlinear dynamical system equations.
